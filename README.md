# Speech_Command_Recogntion
A tutorial to build a simple speech recognition network

This tutorial is adapted from a CMSC422 project. We will be implementing a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and Tensorflow. In the end, we will be able to recognize simple command inputs such as 'Go', 'Stop', etc.
